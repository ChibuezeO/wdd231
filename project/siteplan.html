            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Igbo Cultural Heritage Hub</p>
            <p><strong>Reason:</strong> The name reflects the website’s focus on celebrating and preserving the cultural
                heritage of the Igbo people from Nigeria’s South-East region (Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia, and Ebonyi
                states).
                It is clear, memorable, and directly tied to the project’s mission of promoting Igbo traditions,
                history,
                and community events, making it ideal for branding and recognition.</p>

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The Igbo Cultural Heritage Hub aims to preserve and promote the rich cultural heritage of the Igbo people
                through an engaging website. It will provide:
            <ul>
                <li>Information on Igbo traditions, such as the New Yam Festival (Iwa Ji), marriage customs, and kola
                    nut
                    ceremonies.</li>
                <li>Historical insights into pre-colonial Igbo societies and their modern contributions.</li>
                <li>A community hub for upcoming cultural events like the Ofala Festival and Mmanwu masquerade events,
                    with
                    a platform for user-submitted stories.</li>
            </ul>
            The site will serve as an educational and interactive resource for Igbo people, Nigerians, and global
            audiences
            interested in Igbo culture.

            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> A young Igbo professional living abroad wants to learn about the New Yam
                Festival to connect with their roots. They ask, “What is the significance of the Iwa Ji festival, and
                how is
                it celebrated in different Igbo states?” The site’s Traditions & History page will provide detailed
                explanations and visuals.</p>
            <p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> A tourist planning a trip to Enugu wants to attend a local cultural event.
                They
                ask, “What Igbo cultural events are happening in Enugu this month, and how can I participate?” The
                Community
                & Events page will list upcoming events like Mmanwu masquerade festivals with dates and participation
                details.</p>

                    the
                    lush landscapes of Igbo land and the agricultural significance of the New Yam Festival.</li>
                <li><strong>Coral Red (#FF4040):</strong> Used for headings and accents (e.g., buttons, links) to
                    represent
                    the iconic red caps of Igbo chiefs and the vibrancy of cultural festivals.</li>
            </ul>
